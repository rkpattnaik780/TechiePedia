   <p>Mark Elliot Zuckerberg (born May 14, 1984) is an American computer programmer and Internet entrepreneur. He is the chairman,
                        chief executive officer, and co-founder of Facebook.
      His net worth is estimated to be US $53.6 billion as of 2017, ranking him the 5th richest person in the world.</p>
    <p>Zuckereberg launched Facebook from Harvard's dormitory rooms on February 4, 2004. He was assisted by his college roommates and fellow
                                Harvard University students Eduardo
      Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes. The group then introduced Facebook to other college campuses.</p>
    <p>Facebook expanded rapidly, reaching one billion users by 2012. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg was involved in various legal
                               disputes that were initiated
      by others in the group, who claimed a share of the company based upon their involvement during the development phase of Facebook.</p>
    <p>In December 2012, Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan announced they would give the majority of their wealth over
      the course of their lives to "advancing human potential and promoting equality" in the spirit of The
                   Giving Pledge. On December 1, 2015, they announced they would eventually
       give 99% of their Facebook shares (worth about $45 billion at the time) to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.</p>
    <p>Since 2010, Time magazine has named Zuckerberg among the 100 wealthiest and most influential people
                      in the world as a part of its Person of the Year distinction.
       In December 2016, Zuckerberg was ranked 10th on Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People.</p>

                    <p class="info">Mark Zuckerberg in his childhood</p>
                </div>

<p>Zuckerberg was born in 1984 in White Plains, New York. He is the son of dentist Edward Zuckerberg and psychiatrist
  Karen Kempner. His grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. He and his three sisters, Randi, Donna, and
             Arielle, were brought up in Dobbs Ferry, New York, a small Westchester County
  village about 21 miles north of Midtown Manhattan. Zuckerberg was raised Jewish and had his bar mitzvah when he turned 13. </p>
<p>At Ardsley High School, Zuckerberg excelled in classes. He transferred to the exclusive private school Phillips Exeter
  Academy, in New Hampshire, in his junior year, where he won prizes in science (math, astronomy, and physics) and classical
                           studies. On his college application, Zuckerberg
  claimed that he could read and write French, Hebrew, Latin, and ancient Greek. He was captain of the fencing team.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg began using computers and writing software in middle school. His father taught him Atari BASIC Programming in the 1990s
  , and later hired software developer David Newman to tutor him privately. Newman calls him a "prodigy", adding that it was
   "tough to stay ahead of him". Zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at Mercy College near
    his home while still in high school. He enjoyed developing computer programs, especially communication
     tools and games. In one program, since his father's dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program
     he called "ZuckNet" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate
   with each other. It is considered a "primitive" version of AOL's Instant Messenger, which came out the following year.</p>
  <p>According to writer Jose Antonio Vargas, "some kids played computer games. Mark created them." Zuckerberg himself recalls this period:
     "I had a bunch of friends who were artists. They'd come over, draw stuff, and I'd build a game out of it." However, notes Vargas,
      Zuckerberg was not a typical "geek-klutz", as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma.
          Napster co-founder Sean Parker, a close friend, notes that Zuckerberg was "really into Greek odysseys and all
     that stuff", recalling how he once quoted lines from the Roman epic poem Aeneid, by Virgil, during a Facebook product conference.</p>
  <p>During Zuckerberg's high school years, he worked under the company name Intelligent Media Group to build a music player called the
                      Synapse Media Player. The device used machine learning to
    learn the user's listening habits, which was posted to Slashdot and received a rating of 3 out of 5 from PC Magazine.</p>

    <p>Vargas noted that by the time Zuckerberg began classes at Harvard, he had already achieved a "reputation as a programming prodigy".
       He studied psychology and computer science and belonged to Alpha Epsilon Pi and Kirkland House. In his sophomore year,
        he wrote a program that he called CourseMatch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of
        other students and also to help them form study groups. A short time later, he created a different program he initially
                   called Facemash that let students select the best looking person from a choice of photos.
       According to Arie Hasit, Zuckerberg's roommate at the time, "he built the site for fun". Hasit explains:</p>
       <div class="picinfo">
           <a href="markincollege.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="markincollege.jpg" width="250px" height="250px" alt="A picture of the microsoft team" style="float:left;padding:0px;border:3px solid #e600e6;margin-left:18px;margin-right:15px;margin-top:10px;margin-bottom:5px;
      border-radius:2%;"></a>
           <p class="info">Mark Zuckerberg with his classmates in Harvard .</p>
       </div>
    <p>"We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first,
                     he built a site and placed two pictures, or pictures of two males and two females.
       Visitors to the site had to choose who was "hotter" and according to the votes there would be a ranking."</p>
    <p>The site went up over a weekend; but by Monday morning, the college shut it down because its popularity had overwhelmed one
      of Harvard's network switches and prevented students from accessing the Internet. In addition, many students complained that their
                                       photos were being used
      without permission. Zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was "completely improper."</p>
   <p>Six days after the site launched, three Harvard seniors, Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra, accused
     Zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.com,
               while he was instead using their ideas to
     build a competing product. The three complained to The Harvard Crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation in response.
     Following the official launch of the Facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against Zuckerberg that resulted in
          a settlement. The agreed settlement was for 1.2 million Facebook shares that were worth US$300 million at Facebook's IPO.</p>
     <p>Zuckerberg dropped out of Harvard in his sophomore year to complete his project. In January 2014, Zuckerberg recalled:
      "I remember really vividly, you know, having pizza with my friends a day or two after—I opened up the first version of
      Facebook at the time I thought, "You know, someone needs to build a service like this for the world." But I just never thought
       that we'd be the ones to help do it. And I think a lot of what it comes down to is we just cared more."</p>

                    <p class="info">The co-founders of facebook.</p>
                </div>
<p>Zuckerberg launched Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room on February 4, 2004. An earlier inspiration for Facebook may
  have come from Phillips Exeter Academy, the prep school from which Zuckerberg graduated in 2002. It published its own student
   directory, "The Photo Address Book", which students referred to as "The Facebook". Such photo directories were an important part of
                    the student social experience at many private schools.
  With them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.</p>
<p>Once at college, Zuckerberg's Facebook started off as just a "Harvard thing" until Zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools,
   enlisting the help of roommate Dustin Moskovitz. They began with Columbia, New York University, Stanford,
   Dartmouth, Cornell, Penn, Brown, and Yale. Samyr Laine, a triple jumper representing Haiti at the 2012 Summer
                        Olympics, shared a room with
  Zuckerberg during Facebook's founding. "Mark was clearly on to great things," said Laine, who was Facebook's fourteenth user.</p>
<p>After Zuckerberg moved to Palo Alto, California with Moskovitz and some friends, they leased a small house that served as an office.
  Over the summer, Zuckerberg met Peter Thiel who invested in the company. They got their first office in mid-2004. According to Zuckerberg,
  the group planned to return to Harvard but eventually decided to remain in California. They had already turned down offers by major
   corporations to buy the company. In an interview in 2007, Zuckerberg explained his reasoning: "It's not because of the amount of money.
                    For me and my colleagues, the most important thing is that
  we create an open information flow for people. Having media corporations owned by conglomerates is just not an attractive idea to me."</p>
<p>He restated these goals to Wired magazine in 2010: "The thing I really care about is the mission, making the world open."
   Earlier, in April 2009, Zuckerberg sought the advice of former Netscape CFO Peter Currie about financing strategies for Facebook.
    On July 21, 2010, Zuckerberg reported that the company reached the 500 million-user mark.
   When asked whether Facebook could earn more income from advertising as a result of its phenomenal growth, he explained : "I guess
   we could..... If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query.
   The average for us is a little less than 10 percent of the pages and the average for search is about 20 percent taken up
                  with ads..... That's the simplest thing we could do. But we aren't
    like that. We make enough money. Right, I mean, we are keeping things running; we are growing at the rate we want to."</p>
  <p>In 2010, Steven Levy, who wrote the 1984 book Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution, wrote that Zuckerberg "clearly
    thinks of himself as a hacker". Zuckerberg said that "it's OK to break things" "to make them better". Facebook instituted
    "hackathons" held every six to eight weeks where participants would have one night to conceive of and complete a
    project. The company provided music, food, and beer at the hackathons, and many Facebook staff members, including Zuckerberg,
           regularly attended. "The idea is that you can build something really good in a night",
    Zuckerberg told Levy. "And that's part of the personality of Facebook now..... It's definitely very core to my personality."</p>
 <p>Vanity Fair magazine named Zuckerberg number 1 on its 2010 list of the Top 100 "most influential people of the Information Age".
   Zuckerberg ranked number 23 on the Vanity Fair 100 list in 2009.
    In 2010, Zuckerberg was chosen as number 16 in New Statesman's annual survey of the world's 50 most influential figures. In a
     2011 interview with PBS after the death of Steve Jobs, Zuckerberg said that Jobs had advised him on
    how to create a management team at Facebook that was "focused on building as high quality and good things as you are".</p>
  <p>On October 1, 2012, Zuckerberg visited Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev in Moscow to stimulate social media innovation in
    Russia and to boost Facebook's position in the Russian market. Russia's communications minister tweeted that Prime Minister
    Dmitry Medvedev urged the social media giant's founder to abandon plans to lure away Russian programmers and instead consider opening
    a research center in Moscow. In 2012, Facebook had roughly 9 million users in Russia, while domestic clone VK had
                  around 34 million. Rebecca Van Dyck, Facebook's head of consumer marketing,
    claimed that 85 million American Facebook users were exposed to the first day of the Home promotional campaign on April 6, 2013.</p>
<p>Zuckerberg receives a one-dollar salary as CEO of Facebook. On December 3, 2016 Forbes reported Facebook shares have
   declined 7% since November 8, 2016, reducing Zuckerberg's net worth by 3.7 billion dollars. In June 2016, Business Insider
   named Zuckerberg one of the "Top 10 Business Visionaries Creating Value for the World" along with Elon Musk and Sal Khan,
  due to the fact that he and his wife "pledged to give away 99% of their wealth — which is estimated at over $52.1 billion."</p>

<p>Zuckerberg donated an undisclosed amount to Diaspora, an open-source personal web
  server that implements a distributed social networking service. He called it a "cool idea". Zuckerberg founded the Start-up:
   Education foundation. On September 22, 2010, it was reported that Zuckerberg had donated $100 million to Newark
   Public Schools, the public school system of Newark, New Jersey. Critics noted the timing of the donation as
   being close to the release of The Social Network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of Zuckerberg.
    Zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, "The thing that I was most sensitive about with the movie timing was,
     I didn't want the press about The Social Network movie to get conflated with the Newark project. I was thinking about
      doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate." Newark Mayor Cory A. Booker stated
                      that he and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie had to convince Zuckerberg's
  team not to make the donation anonymously. The money was largely wasted, according to journalist Dale Russakoff.</p>
<p>On December 9, 2010, Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and investor Warren Buffett signed a promise they called "The Giving Pledge ", in which they promised to donate to charity at
   half of their wealth over the course of time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50% or more of their wealth to charity. On
   December 19, 2013, Zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million Facebook shares to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation,
   to be executed by the end of the month—based on Facebook's valuation as of then, the shares totaled $990 million in value. On December
   31, 2013, the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for 2013. The Chronicle of Philanthropy
           placed Zuckerberg and
   his wife at the top of the magazine's annual list of 50 most generous Americans for 2013, having donated roughly $1 billion to charity.</p>
<p>On December 1, 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan announced the birth of their daughter Max, and in an open letter to Max, they pledged
  to donate 99% of their Facebook shares, then valued at $45 billion, to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, their new organization that
  will focus on health and education. The donation will not be given immediately, but over the course of their lives. However,
   instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to, as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Larry Page,
            Sergey Brin and other tech billionaires have done,
   Zuckerberg and Chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company. This has drawn criticism from a number of journalists.</p>
